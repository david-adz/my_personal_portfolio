My Personal Portfolio
This file is made up of online JQuery libraries and fontawsome icons.
Kindly Clone/Download, if you have to.
You can also create a folder on your local machine if you have to.
After cloning my portfolio folder, locate slide-screen.html file and open with any browser of your choice.

And that should work.


Kindly feel free to let me know if theres any challenge or my little instruction is not clear.
